description: CETIN corporate design system and brand guidelines. Apply CETIN branding (CETIN Blue + Red, Avenir/Arial, official logos, brand layouts) to visual outputs — presentations, HTML/React artifacts, dashboards, Excel charts, and Word documents. USE ONLY for business/work output (CETIN deliverables, internal reports, customer-facing material, team or stakeholder decks, BA docs, anything in the user's CETIN role). DO NOT USE for personal or non-business work (personal projects, family, school, travel, fiction, hobby code, personal finance, etc.) — fall back to neutral design. ALWAYS SKIP when the user opts out ("plain", "unbranded", "no branding", "not for CETIN", "different design"). When ambiguous, ask once whether the request is for CETIN/work or personal before applying branding.

# CETIN Design System

You are producing output for CETIN, a Czech telecommunications infrastructure company (member
of PPF Group). Every visual deliverable must follow the CETIN brand identity described below.
The goal is a consistent, professional, instantly recognizable look across all formats.

---

## When to apply this skill (and when NOT to)

CETIN branding is for **business / work output only**. Before applying any colors, logos,
fonts, or layouts from this guide, decide whether the current request is business or personal.

**Apply CETIN branding when** the output is for work:
- CETIN-internal documents, reports, dashboards, or apps
- Customer- or partner-facing materials produced on behalf of CETIN
- Team meetings, stakeholder updates, sales/exec decks, BA workflows
- Anything where the user is acting in their CETIN role

**Do NOT apply CETIN branding when** the context is personal or non-business:
- Personal projects, hobby code, side experiments
- Family planning, school work, travel itineraries, gifts, personal events
- Fiction, creative writing, music, art for personal use
- Personal blogs, personal finance, learning exercises
- Anything outside the user's CETIN job

For personal output, fall back to a neutral / default design — no CETIN blue, no CETIN logos,
no Avenir, no triangle pattern. Use whatever generic style fits the task.

**Always skip CETIN branding when the user explicitly opts out**, e.g. "plain", "unbranded",
"no branding", "personal style", "use a different design", "not for CETIN" — even if the topic
could otherwise look work-related. Honor the request immediately and do not re-apply CETIN
visuals later in the same conversation unless the user asks for them.

**When ambiguous**, ask once: "Is this for CETIN / work, or a personal project?" Do not assume.

For the full specification with CSS variables, Tailwind presets, and PptxGenJS config, read
`references/design-guidelines.md` in this skill's directory. Below is the working summary you
need for day-to-day output. Wording and values come from the official CETIN Brand Guidelines
(EN V17, 2023) — call the primary brand color **CETIN BLUE**, never "purple."

## Logo

### Quick decision tree — which logo file to use

Apply this every time you place a logo. Works identically in chat answers, generated code,
Word/PowerPoint/Excel output, HTML/React artifacts, or Cowork-driven file edits. Audience
language does **not** affect logo choice — the international CMYK PNGs are canonical for
every CETIN deliverable (Czech, English, internal, external, .cz domain materials, all of it).

1. **Which sub-brand is the deliverable for?**
   - DunAI initiative? → use the **DunAI** files (see Sub-brands §3 below).
   - CETIN.DIGITAL programme? → use the **standard CETIN** PNG files plus the CETIN.DIGITAL text mark.
   - Anything else? → use the **standard CETIN** PNG files. Continue to step 2.
2. **What's the background color the logo will sit on?**
   - Dark background (CETIN-blue area, near-black, dark photo) → `*_negativ_*` (white wordmark) file.
   - Light background (white, light gray, light photo) → `*_pozitiv_*` (CETIN-blue wordmark) file.

This decision is the same whether you are typing the path into a PptxGenJS call, an `<img src>`,
a markdown reference, or a Cowork file-write. **Always use the relative path inside `references/`.**

### Official files — the only canonical CETIN logos

| File | Use on | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `references/CETIN_CMYK_negativ_international.png` | Dark backgrounds | White CETIN wordmark + red triangle |
| `references/CETIN_CMYK_pozitiv_international.png` | Light backgrounds | CETIN-blue wordmark + red triangle |

These two PNGs are the canonical CETIN logo for **every** CETIN material — Czech and English,
internal and external, cetin.cz and international, CETIN.DIGITAL programme materials included.
They are the only files in `references/` with the correct construction (the wedge-cut C, the
official triangle proportions, the brand-spec colors).

> **Warning — do not use the `.cz` SVG placeholders.** The files
> `references/logo_cetin_dark_cz.svg` and `references/logo_cetin_light_cz.svg` are 222-byte
> simplified placeholders (a plain triangle plus bare "CETIN" text in a generic sans-serif,
> with no wedge-cut on the C and incorrect typography). They look unofficial when rendered
> and **must not be embedded in any deliverable**. Treat them as a known issue until proper
> Czech-domain SVGs arrive — at which point this section will be updated to point at them.

If even the canonical PNGs are somehow unavailable, fall back to a styled-text logo: `▶ CETIN`
with the triangle in CETIN red (`#f12e49`) and the wordmark in CETIN blue (`#300091`) on light
backgrounds, or white on dark backgrounds. The wordmark must always be **uppercase, bold
sans-serif**. This fallback is for emergencies only — every bundled deliverable should embed
the actual PNG.

### Embedding the PNGs — always crop to alpha bbox first

The canonical PNGs ship at 3508×1250 with substantial transparent padding. If you embed them
raw, the visible logo will end up tiny inside its placement box and the deck will look broken.
**Always crop to the alpha bounding box before embedding.** Use this Python recipe:

```python
from PIL import Image

img = Image.open('references/CETIN_CMYK_pozitiv_international.png').convert('RGBA')
margin = int(min(img.size) * 0.02)
b = img.getbbox()
img.crop((
    max(0, b[0] - margin),
    max(0, b[1] - margin),
    min(img.size[0], b[2] + margin),
    min(img.size[1], b[3] + margin),
)).save('logo_official_light.png')
# Cropped aspect ratio is ~5.55:1.
```

Run the same recipe on `CETIN_CMYK_negativ_international.png` to produce a dark-bg variant.
Embed the cropped output directly via your format's native image API:

- **PptxGenJS:** `slide.addImage({ path: 'logo_official_light.png', x, y, w, h })`
- **python-pptx:** `slide.shapes.add_picture('logo_official_light.png', x, y, width, height)`
- **HTML / React:** `<img src="references/CETIN_CMYK_pozitiv_international.png" alt="CETIN" />`
  (browsers handle transparent padding via CSS `object-fit`)
- **docx (python-docx):** `paragraph.add_run().add_picture('logo_official_light.png', width=...)`
- **Excel (openpyxl / xlsxwriter):** `worksheet.insert_image(...)` / `add_image(...)`

**Direct PNG embed only.** Do not convert to SVG, do not redraw with `cairosvg`, do not
reconstruct from primitive shapes. The CMYK PNG is the source of truth.

### Logo placement on slides (CETIN house rule)

This is a deliberate house rule that **overrides** the brand manual's top-left default:

- **Intro slides, chapter slides, dividers, title slides** → logo **bottom-left**, full size
- **Content slides** → logo **bottom-right**, smaller (≈60–70% of intro-slide size)

Logo always sits within the clear-space margin (1× triangle height on all sides). On a 16:9
slide at 1920×1080, the intro-slide logo is typically 240–280 px wide; the content-slide logo
is typically 140–180 px wide.

### Logo construction (per brand manual §2.7)

The logo is **not** a generic right-pointing triangle plus text — it is a constructed mark:

- The **C** in CETIN has a wedge (negative space) cut from the left side of its bowl, shaped
  as an equilateral triangle whose side equals 5% of the logo text height.
- The **red triangle** sits to the left of the wordmark. Its side equals 90% of the wordmark
  height. Its median (to the midpoint of the vertical right side) crosses the central
  horizontal axis of the wordmark.
- Logo with claim: claim baseline sits 2.5× claim-text-height below the wordmark baseline.

**MANDATORY: always embed the canonical PNG file.** Do not redraw the logo from scratch, do
not approximate it with native shapes, do not regenerate it as an SVG. The cropped CMYK PNG
is the only acceptable source for any deliverable.

### Clear space and minimum size (per brand manual §2.8, §2.16)

- **Clear space:** the height of the red triangle, on all sides. No other elements may enter
  this zone.
- **Minimum size:** 100 px wide recommended; 60 px absolute minimum. Below 100 px, prefer the
  logo without claim.

### Logo with claim vs. without claim (per brand manual §2.2)

- **Without claim** (default): B2C communication, customer-facing materials, small formats.
- **With claim** ("MEMBER OF PPF GROUP"): B2B, internal, and international communication.

The claim is set in Avenir Next LT Pro Demi Bold, all caps, lowercase tracking 5 pt, sized
9.5 pt when the logo is 50 mm wide.

### Prohibited use (per brand manual §2.18)

Do not:

- Change the size or position of any individual part of the logo.
- Display an incomplete logo.
- Change the font, size, or position of the wordmark.
- Place the logo or any part of it inside a line frame.
- Add other graphic elements to the logo.
- Apply filters or effects (drop shadow, glow, blur, etc.).
- Recolor the logo outside the brand palette.
- Stretch, rotate, or distort the logo.

| White           | `#ffffff` | Default content area background                       |

### Digital-only background palette (per brand manual §4.5 — screen/email/banner only, not print)

`#f5f6fa`  ·  `#d7dae1`  ·  `#cdd4e5`  ·  `#66678a`

These can be reduced to 50% or 75% opacity. Use for app/dashboard chrome and email headers.

### Complementary palette (per brand manual §4.4 — for charts, illustrations, infographics)

Use these in this order for chart series, in addition to CETIN blue and CETIN red:

```
#3F3E98   #87C4E7   #7078B8   #1F4D9A   #81C78F   #70D1E2
#49A2D8   #6AC9BB   #DEE5F1   #C6E4EF   #F3D9DD   #D4EAD5
```

### Gradients (per brand manual)

- **Primary:** turquoise `#70D1E2` → blue `#1F4D9A` at **145°**, **30% opacity**
- **Secondary:** purple `#A7A4E0` → blue `#99D6EA` at **0°**, **20% opacity**

### Data visualization series order

`#300091` → `#f12e49` → `#41b6e6` → `#6f79bd` → `#3F3E98` → `#1F4D9A` → `#70D1E2` → `#c7c9c7`

---

## Typography

### Primary typeface — Avenir Next LT Pro

Use whenever the format supports it (InDesign, Figma, Photoshop, anywhere the font is licensed
and installed). Cuts: **Bold**, **Demi Bold**, **Regular**.

### Secondary / fallback typeface — Arial

Use as fallback when Avenir Next LT Pro is not available — this includes **PowerPoint, Word,
web/HTML, Excel, and most generated outputs**. Cuts: **Bold**, **Regular**. Do **not** use
Arial Black, Helvetica, Montserrat, Open Sans, or any other substitute.

### Heading rules

- **H1 / slide titles:** Avenir Bold or Arial Bold, **ALL CAPS**, CETIN Blue on light bg or
  white on blue bg. A4 reference: 47 pt headline. Slides 16:9: 36–48 pt.
- **H2 / sections:** Avenir Bold or Arial Bold, ALL CAPS, 28–32 pt, CETIN Blue.
- **H3 / subsections:** Avenir Demi Bold or Arial Bold, normal case, 20–24 pt, CETIN Blue or white.
- **Body:** Avenir Regular or Arial Regular, 14–20 pt (20 pt for A4 print body), `#000000` or
  `#1A1A1A` on light bg, white on blue bg. Line height 1.5–1.6.
- **Captions:** Avenir Regular or Arial Regular, 12 pt, gray.

### Multi-sentence headlines (per brand manual §6.1.6)

Multi-sentence headlines are separated by **a blank line, not a period** (Czech texts always;
other languages may use a period if needed). The space between sentences is double the line
spacing.

---

## Layout — the signature CETIN layout

The defining CETIN layout is a **beveled CETIN-blue area + photograph** split:

### The blue area (per brand manual §6.1.4)

- A **CETIN Blue (`#300091`)** area takes part of the canvas (roughly 1/3 to 2/3 of the
  width on landscape A4 / 16:9 slides; can be split horizontally on portrait/narrow formats).
- The dividing edge is **beveled at -6°** (a slight slope, not a straight vertical edge).
- Minimum / maximum size: between 6 and the full width's worth of the triangle module.
- Logo sits in this blue area (top-left preferred per manual; CETIN house rule places it in
  bottom-left for intro/chapter slides — see "Logo placement" above).
- Headline and body copy live in the blue area, set in white.

### The photograph (per brand manual §6.1.5, §6.1.7)

- Fills the other side of the canvas.
- Where text overlaps the photo, slightly darken the photo so the text remains legible — the
  darkening must look natural, not heavy-handed.
- Photo content: real CETIN infrastructure, technicians, network/digital scenes — not
  generic stock.

### The CTA / web address frame (per brand manual §6.1.8)

- Bottom-right corner of the photo (or bottom-left if the photo is on the left).
- **CETIN red `#f12e49`** stroke, **sharp corners** (no rounding).
- Avenir Medium or Arial Bold, **lowercase**, no `www.` prefix. A4 reference: 20 pt.

### The triangle pattern (per brand manual §6.2)

CETIN's secondary visual element is a pattern made of repeated CETIN red triangles, used as
decoration:

- Triangles in the pattern are the **same size** as the triangle in the logo.
- Pattern always sits at the **bottom** of the layout — never at the top.
- Pattern must not dominate the visual; photo and content area always take more space.
- Do not use the pattern in vertical-split layouts where it competes with the photo.

### Layout for documents (Word, PDF)

- Section headings: CETIN Blue, bold, all caps for H1 / H2.
- Branded table style (header row CETIN Blue, alternating white / `#f5f6fa` rows, borders
  `#d9d9d6`).
- Footer: thin CETIN red rule + page number in Avenir Regular.

---

## Sub-brands

There are three identities. Default to **CETIN** unless the user specifies otherwise.

### 1. CETIN (default)

Use for everything unless told otherwise. **One canonical pair, used for every audience and
every market** (Czech, English, internal, external, .cz domain, CETIN.DIGITAL — all of it):

- Dark backgrounds: `references/CETIN_CMYK_negativ_international.png`
- Light backgrounds: `references/CETIN_CMYK_pozitiv_international.png`

Pick by background, not by audience.

> **Warning — the `.cz` SVG files in `references/` are 222-byte placeholders** with the wrong
> typography and no wedge-cut on the C. Do not use `logo_cetin_dark_cz.svg` or
> `logo_cetin_light_cz.svg` in any deliverable until proper Czech-domain SVGs replace them.

### 2. CETIN.DIGITAL (Czech CETIN digital transformation programme)

Use when context is CETIN.DIGITAL slides or materials.

- **Not a separate logo file** — it is a text treatment: render as **"CETIN"** in CETIN Blue
  (`#300091`) + **"DIGITAL"** in CETIN Red (`#f12e49`), both **bold, ALL CAPS**, no period
  between them in the rendered output (the brand uses "CETIN.DIGITAL" in copy but treats the
  visual mark as two adjacent words).
- Use as title-prefix or header badge on CETIN.DIGITAL title slides and section dividers.
  Body of the deck still uses standard CETIN branding.

### 3. DunAI by ▶ CETIN (international / cross-country AI initiative)

Use when context involves DunAI — CETIN's international AI initiative spanning Hungary,
Bulgaria, Serbia, Slovakia, etc.

- **Logo files:**
  - Dark backgrounds: `references/DunAI_logo_white.png` — white "DunAI" wordmark with
    decorative wave lines + "by ▶ CETIN" sub-mark. Use on CETIN-blue, near-black, or photo
    backdrops with sufficient contrast.
  - Light / white backgrounds: `references/DunAI_logo_transparent_background.png` — same
    mark with transparent canvas, designed to sit on white or light surfaces.
- Palette leans more "digital/network": you may use the secondary gradient (purple → blue) or
  the primary gradient (turquoise → blue) more prominently.
- Place the DunAI mark where the CETIN logo would normally sit (per house placement rules above).

> Note: CETIN.DIGITAL and DunAI are skill extensions and are **not** in the 2023 brand manual.
> They follow the standard CETIN palette and typography but are positioned as sub-brands.

---

## Co-branding — "POWERED BY CETIN" sticker (per brand manual §3)

When CETIN branding appears alongside a partner's brand:

- Use the technological signature **only as a sticker** ("POWERED BY CETIN" wordmark with the
  red triangle).
- Clear space around the sticker: equal to the height of the text section.
- Minimum sizes by format: A3 = 70 mm, A4 = 45 mm, A5/DL = 30 mm, A6 = 20 mm; digital
  minimum 100 px.

---

## Component Styles

### Buttons

- **Primary:** background `#f12e49`, white text, `border-radius: 4px`, **uppercase**, Arial
  Bold or Avenir Bold, weight 700.
- **Secondary:** transparent with `2px solid #300091` border, CETIN Blue text.
- **On dark / blue area:** white background, CETIN Blue text.

### Tables

Always use real table markup (`<table>` in HTML, table objects in PPTX/XLSX/DOCX).

- **Header row:** background `#300091`, white text, bold, ALL CAPS.
- **Body rows:** alternating `#FFFFFF` and `#f5f6fa`.
- **Borders:** `1px solid #d9d9d6`.
- **Hover (web):** `rgba(48, 0, 145, 0.05)`.

### Cards

White background, `border-radius: 8px`, `box-shadow: 0 2px 12px rgba(48,0,145,0.08)`, 24 px
padding, optional `4px solid #300091` left border.

### Icons

Line icons (1.5–2 px stroke), rounded caps, **CETIN Blue on light backgrounds, white on dark**.
Recommended sets: Lucide, Phosphor, Heroicons (outline).

---

## Format-Specific Notes

### Presentations (.pptx)

- 16:9, 1920×1080.
- **Title / chapter / divider slides:** full-bleed CETIN Blue background **or** the beveled
  blue-area + photo layout. Headline in white, ALL CAPS. Logo bottom-left, full size.
- **Content slides — light mode is the default.** Background: pure white (`#FFFFFF`). Use
  `#f5f6fa` only as a deliberate section panel inside the slide, never as a full-slide
  background.
  - **Title:** plain CETIN Blue (`#300091`) text on white, Arial Bold (or Avenir Bold), ALL
    CAPS, 28–36 pt, left-aligned, in the upper portion of the slide. **No filled blue
    header bar. No photo strip behind the title. No accent line directly under the title**
    (an under-title rule is an AI-slide tell — do not add one).
  - **Optional eyebrow:** a small uppercase eyebrow line in CETIN Blue *above* the title
    is fine — Arial Bold 10–12 pt with `charSpacing: 4` (PptxGenJS) / equivalent letter-
    spacing in other formats. This is the only mark allowed near the title.
  - **Body / content area:** dark text (`#000000` or `#1A1A1A`) on white. Tables, charts,
    and components follow the brand styles in their respective sections.
  - **Logo:** bottom-right, smaller (≈140–180 px wide on 1920×1080).
- **Where the brand color belongs on a content slide:** in the title type, in the logo, in
  small accent rules (max 6–8 px CETIN Red as a divider or callout strike), and in chapter
  dividers. **Not** in colored bars stretched across content slides.
- When the pptx skill is also active, use the PptxGenJS color and font constants in
  `references/design-guidelines.md` §8.

### React / HTML artifacts

- Use inline styles or hand-rolled CSS — paste the CSS variables block from
  `references/design-guidelines.md` §7.
- Lucide icons via `lucide-react`.
- For dashboards: app shell uses CETIN Blue header, sidebar `#1A0060` (deep blue) or `#300091`,
  content area `#f5f6fa`, cards white.

### Excel (.xlsx)

- Apply the data visualization palette (in series order) to charts.
- Header rows use CETIN Blue background + white bold text.
- Conditional formatting: positive = `#41b6e6` (light blue), negative = `#f12e49` (CETIN red).

### Word (.docx)

- Heading styles in CETIN Blue.
- Branded table style (header row CETIN Blue, alternating white / `#f5f6fa`).
- Page footer with thin CETIN red rule and "MEMBER OF PPF GROUP" in Arial Demi Bold caps,
  9 pt, gray.

---

## Default Mode: Light

**Light mode is the default for content slides.** Background is pure white. Brand color shows
up as title type, in the logo, and in small accent rules — not as colored fills stretched
across slides. This is the routine internal-content default and produces calm, professional,
human-looking decks rather than the "AI-generated" colored-bar look.

Use **dark mode** (full CETIN-Blue background or near-black with white text) **only** in these
contexts — anywhere else, default to white:

- Title and chapter divider slides.
- The beveled CETIN-Blue area within a marketing split-layout slide.
- Hero sections of dashboards.
- DunAI materials, where the digital/network feel is appropriate.

The signature **beveled blue-area + photo** layout (described in the Layout section above) is
reserved for **marketing-style hero slides** — campaign visuals, customer-facing decks, the
opening slide of a sales deck. **Do not apply it to routine internal content** (status
updates, all-hands decks, working sessions, weekly reports). Routine content lives on white.

---

## Do's and Don'ts

**Do:**

- Use **CETIN Blue (`#300091`)** as the dominant brand color — never call it "purple" in
  generated copy or alt text.
- Use **Avenir Next LT Pro** when supported, **Arial** as fallback. Never use Arial Black.
- Apply CETIN Red sparingly — logo triangle, CTA frame, accent rules only.
- Use the official logo files from `references/`. Place per the house rule (bottom-left on
  intro/chapter; bottom-right smaller on content).
- Use the beveled blue-area + photo layout where the format allows. Bevel at -6°.
- Keep the triangle pattern at the bottom of layouts only, sized to match the logo triangle.
- Multi-sentence headlines: separate with a blank line, not a period.

**Don't:**

- Don't call `#300091` "purple" — it is **CETIN Blue**.
- Don't use Arial Black, Montserrat, or any non-Avenir/non-Arial font.
- Don't use red as a background color — it is strictly an accent.
- Don't recolor or distort the logo (see prohibited uses above).
- Don't put the triangle pattern at the top of the layout, or let it dominate the visual.
- Don't use the data-viz cyan or "purple" colors from older skill versions — use the
  manual-sourced complementary palette.
- Don't mix more than 3 brand colors per slide / screen.
- Don't place white text on light backgrounds without sufficient contrast (use the blue area
  underneath).
- **Don't put a full-bleed colored title bar across the top of every content slide.** Plain
  CETIN-Blue type on white is the default for content slides.
- **Don't put an accent line directly under a slide title.** Under-title rules are an AI-slide
  tell — leave the space below the title clean.
- Don't use the `.cz` SVG placeholders (`logo_cetin_*_cz.svg`) for any deliverable — they are
  222-byte simplified files with the wrong typography. Use the canonical CMYK PNGs.
- Don't embed the canonical PNGs without first cropping to the alpha bbox — raw they have
  large transparent padding and will render tiny in their placement box.
