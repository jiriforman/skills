# Master content file — template

One `.md` is the single source of truth for the whole training. The HTML decks are *built from
it*; it also carries everything that never appears on a slide. Never let the decks become the
master — an edit made in the browser does not flow back here.

Save as `<Training_Name>_slide_text.md`.

```markdown
# <Training name> — Slide Text & Facilitator Notes

**<Programme> · CETIN**
Audience: <who, and any bimodal split>. Keep on-slide text simple; depth lives in the notes.

Structure: **N topics + bridge · M slides, plus B backup slides.**
(Rendered: M content slides + D chapter dividers + 1 title = T.)
Each slide has on-slide text, facilitator notes, and a one-line key message.

## Storyline Overview (navigation)

**Throughline:** one sentence per topic, chained with arrows, so the whole arc reads in one breath.

| # | Topic | Slides | Core arc | Ends on |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **<Topic>** | 1.1–1.4 | a → b → c | the beat it hands off on |
| **B** | **Backup — <subject> detail** | B1–B6 | … | Only if challenged |

🖼️ = slide or section rendered from a supplied HTML/image file, not built from this text.

**Built assets:** open **`index.html`** — it lists every chapter and links to any single slide.

| File | Contents | Slides |
|---|---|---|
| `index.html` | **Start here** — contents page | — |
| `<Name>_Topic1-2.html` | Title · T1 divider · 1.1–1.4 · T2 divider · 2.1–2.6 | 13 |
| `assets/` | Images/video a deck references — **must stay next to it** | — |

*Navigation, common to every deck: Contents button top-left; quiet counter top-right; arrows roll
over into the next/previous chapter file at the ends. Deep links work: `file.html#3`.*

*Edit mode (**E**) changes the page in the browser only. **⌘S / Ctrl+S** downloads an edited copy.
Substantive changes belong in this .md, or the two will drift.*

**Slide-by-slide index**

| Slide | Title | Key message |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | … | one line |

## TOPIC 1 — <NAME>

> 🖼️ **BUILT SLIDES AVAILABLE — render from file, do not rebuild by hand.**
> **Source:** `<file>.html` — N slides. Which visuals come from where, and any asset the deck
> depends on. ⚠️ List any slide still awaiting real content.

*Optional tone note for the topic.*

### Slide 1.1 — <Title>

**On-slide text**
- Exactly what appears on the slide, verbatim. Tables as markdown tables.

**Facilitator notes**
- What to say, what to ask the room, callbacks and forward links by slide number.
- Where a figure is contested or a claim is ours rather than a source's, say so here.

**Key message:** one sentence.

*Sources: … with links. Note anything that moves fast and should be re-verified.*

---

## Sources (validated)

- **<Claim family>** — figure, source, link, method note, and what to re-check before quoting.
- Mark clearly where numbers are **our own arithmetic** rather than a published figure.
```

## Rules that keep this file useful

1. **On-slide text is verbatim.** If it is not on the slide, it goes in the notes. This is what
   lets you rebuild a deck from the file months later.
2. **Every derived number shows its arithmetic** in the sources section — baseline, divisor,
   assumption. Someone will challenge a figure from the floor.
3. **Distinguish published from calculated.** "Our own illustrative arithmetic" is a phrase worth
   repeating.
4. **Facilitator notes carry the caveats**, so the slide can stay clean and the presenter still
   knows where the soft ground is.
5. **Keep the index and the asset table current** on every build — they are how anyone finds
   anything.
6. **Placeholders are explicit**: `[ TO WRITE — … ]`, and mirrored by a visible
   `.pending-note` on the built slide. Never quietly ship an empty slide.
7. **The Storyline Overview is a gate, not documentation written after the fact.** Draft it,
   show it, and get a go before writing a single slide fragment — see "Before anything else:
   agree the storyline" in `SKILL.md`. Reworking this table is a few lines; reworking slides built
   against the wrong shape is the whole deck.
